### 2. **Web Search Tool** (`web_search`)
**Purpose**: General web search with content extraction and summarization

#### Capabilities:
- DuckDuckGo search integration
- Content extraction from web pages
- Automatic summarization of fetched content
- Timeout and error handling

#### Examples:
```bash
# Information queries

```

#### Sample Output:
```
Agent: Quantum computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm that uses quantum mechanical phenomena 
like superposition and entanglement to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits 
(0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits which can exist in multiple states simultaneously...

### 5. **RAG Tool** (`rag_query`)
**Purpose**: Question answering over local documents using vector search

#### Capabilities:
- Semantic search over PDF, Markdown, and text files
- Vector embeddings using sentence-transformers
- ChromaDB for efficient vector storage
- Context-aware document retrieval

#### Setup:
```bash
# 1. Place documents in knowledge/ folder
mkdir knowledge
# Add your PDFs, .md, .txt files

# 2. Build index
python rag_index.py --rebuild

# 3. Query documents
> ask rag: what did my MailGuard paper claim about privacy?
> ask rag: summarize the Q3 report
> ask rag: what are the key findings from the research?
```

#### Sample Output:
```
Agent: Based on your MailGuard paper, it claims that:
- Privacy-preserving email filtering is achievable through encrypted pattern matching
- The system maintains 95% accuracy while protecting user data
- Computational overhead is minimal (<5% performance impact)

# Mathematical calculations
> calc: (15% CAGR SIP on 80k for 36 months)
> calc: 2^10 + sqrt(100)
> calc: sin(30 degrees) * cos(45 degrees)
> calc: compound_interest(100000, 0.08, 5)

# Data calculations
> calc: [1,2,3,4,5].mean()
> calc: sum(range(1, 101))
> calc: len("hello world") * 2
```
